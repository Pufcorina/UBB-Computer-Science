Regular grammars and finite automata

Write a program that:
1. Reads a grammar (from keyboard and from file)
2. Displays the elements of a grammar, using a menu: set of non-terminals, set of terminals,  set of productions, the productions of a given non-terminal symbol
3. Verifies if the grammar is regular
4. Reads the elements of a FA (from keyboard and from file)
5. Displays the elements of a finite automata, using a menu: the set of states, the alphabet, all the transitions, the set of final state.
6. Given a regular grammar constructs the corresponding finite automaton.
7. Given a finite automaton constructs the corresponding regular grammar.
