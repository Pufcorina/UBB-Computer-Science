# Lab 7 - Parallelizing techniques

# Goal
The goal of this lab is to implement a simple but non-trivial parallel algorithm.

# Requirement
Solve both problems below:

1. Given a sequence of n numbers, compute the sums of the first k numbers, for each k between 1 and n. Parallelize the computations, to optimize for low latency on a large number of processors. Use at most 2*n additions, but no more than 2*log(n) additions on each computation path from inputs to an output. Example: if the input sequence is 1 5 2 4, then the output should be 1 6 8 12.

2. Add n big numbers. We want the result to be obtained digit by digit, starting with the least significant one, and as soon as possible. For this reason, you should use n-1 threads, each adding two numbers. Each thread should pass the result to the next thread. Arrange the threads in a binary tree. Each thread should pass the sum to the next thread through a queue, digit by digit.

# The documentation will describe:
- the algorithms,
- the synchronization used in the parallelized variants,
- the performance measurements
