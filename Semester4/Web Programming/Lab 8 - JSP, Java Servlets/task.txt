Solve the following problem using the JSP/Servlet technology. 
State information (between web requests) is always stored in a database; 
you may store some state information in cookies/session objects. 
Write a web application which allows users to upload pictures. 
Each user sees the pictures of all users and he/she can assign votes (natural numbers) 
for other users' pictures (not for his own pictures). If a picture gets votes from several users, 
these votes are added. The application then displays the top N pictures and the corresponding authors of these pictures, 
based on the number of votes; the number N should be chosen by the user. 
Each user must identify himself prior to using the application.
